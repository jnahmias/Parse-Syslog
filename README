Parse/Syslog
============

DESCRIPTION

Unix syslogs are convenient to read for humans but because
of small differences between operating systems and things
like 'last message repeated xx times' not very easy to parse
by a script.

Parse::Syslog presents a simple interface to parse syslog
files: you create a parser on a file (with new) and call
next to get one line at a time with Unix-timestamp, host,
program, pid and text returned in a hash-reference.
